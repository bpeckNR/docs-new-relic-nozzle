<br/>
This documentation describes [New Relic Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/nr-firehose-nozzle/). 

New Relic Nozzle for PCF collects metrics and events that are generated by all PCF components and applications that run on PCF Diego cells via the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html). It pushes this data to [New Relic](https://www.newrelic.com) to be ingested by New Relic Insights for dashboarding and visualization.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

<p>Once you install New Relic Nozzle for PCF, it starts collecting and pushing Firehose events to 
New Relic Insights for visualization. New Relic organizes the Firehose data based on Firehose event 
types, and shows each Firehose event type in its own separate dashboard.</p>

The nozzle can be installed as a tile in Ops Manager, or deployed using the CLI command **cf push** as a regular application. You can then monitor the health and performance of your PCF deployments, 
and set alerts based on any metrics that are collected from PCF Firehose.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

You can filter the nozzle dashboards that allow you to visualize the Firehose metrics and events.

Monitor the health and performance of PCF components with the following categories:

    * PCF Domain
    * PCF Deployment
    * Firehose Event Type
    * Origin
    * Job
    * Component IP Address
    * Application ID
    * Container

Select the item from a list of values for any of the above metrics and filter the dashboard based on the selected value. You can filter a dashboard by multiple metrics.

## <a id='filters'></a>Event Filtering

The nozzle allows for filtering out undesired events that are generated by the firehose. In cases where there are events coming from certain **"deployment"**, **"origin"**, or **"job"**, that you do not particularly care about, or they are not vital to watch in your environment, you can tell the nozzle to exclude them.
